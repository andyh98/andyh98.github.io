## Projects

Here are some of the passion projects I have been working on using HTML, CSS and Javascript. These were completed without the use of any front-end frameworks or external API's, for the sake of learning the fundamentals of front-end scripting. Any images included have been created by myself using Adobe Illustrator (Ex. The pen in Live Pen tool).

[Live Pen](https://andyh98.github.io/Live_Pen/): A whiteboard tool developed using HTML Canvas

[Color Glow](https://andyh98.github.io/Color_Glow): My first project using HTML Canvas. A visual resembling stadium lights that can be clicked through.
