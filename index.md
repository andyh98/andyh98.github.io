## Projects

[ScreenIt](https://github.com/ScreenIt-Inc/ScreenIt): A contactless customer screening and contact tracing system for business to operate safely during a pandemic. My team and I worked on ScreenIt over the span of 8 months taking on tasks encompassing the entire software lifecycle, from design to deployment

[ReFlect](https://murmuring-forest-00201.herokuapp.com/): Digital journaling app with a journaling prompt feature to spark an interesting journal entry. The app was created using Flask microframework with a PostgreSQL database and deployed through Heroku.

### HTML, CSS & JS

Here are some of the projects I have been working on using HTML, CSS and Javascript. These were completed without the use of any front-end frameworks or external API's, for the sake of learning the fundamentals of front-end scripting. Any images included have been created by myself using Adobe Illustrator (Ex. The pen in Live Pen tool).

[Live Pen](https://andyh98.github.io/Live_Pen/): A whiteboard tool developed using HTML Canvas

[Color Glow](https://andyh98.github.io/Color_Glow): My first project using HTML Canvas. A visual resembling stadium lights that can be clicked through.
