## Projects

Welcome to my sandbox projects page. This page contains coding projects for experimentation and learning purposes. These were completed without the use of any front-end frameworks or external APIs, for the sake of learning the fundamentals of frontend development HTML, CSS and JS. Any images included have been created by myself using Adobe Illustrator (Ex. The pen in Live Pen tool).

[Live Pen](https://andyh98.github.io/Live_Pen/): A whiteboard tool developed using HTML Canvas

[Color Glow](https://andyh98.github.io/Color_Glow): My first project using HTML Canvas. A visual resembling stadium lights that can be clicked through.

## Certificates

Certifications I have earned to develop my frontend skills and knowledge. It is a constant work in progress, as new technologies and frameworks emerge.
