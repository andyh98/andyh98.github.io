## Welcome to My Projects Page

Here are some of the projects I have worked on in the past and am currently working on:

[Live Pen](https://andyh98.github.io/Live_Pen/): A whiteboard tool developed using Canvas
[Color Glow](https://andyh98.github.io/Color_Glow): My first project using Canvas. A visual resembling stadium lights that is entertaining to click through.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andyh98/andyh98.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
